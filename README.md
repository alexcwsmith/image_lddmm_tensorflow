## Examples
Please see Examples.ipynb to see application to human brain and mouse brain.  More examples will be forthcoming.

## To do
1. (coding) Figure out details of running this code on GPU
1. (application) Incorporate more example model organisms, and choose optimal parameters fo reach
1. (algorithms) Incorporate moddern techniques for working with artifacts, missing data, and differences in image contrast
